Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting reproductive aged women worldwide. It is characterized by a complex interplay of hormonal imbalances, metabolic dysfunction, and ovarian abnormalities. Early detection and diagnosis of PCOS are crucial for timely intervention and management of the condition. This abstract presents an overview of various approaches and advancements in PCOS detection, highlighting both traditional and emerging methods. The traditional diagnostic criteria for PCOS include the Rotterdam criteria, which require the presence of at least two out of three features: irregular menstrual cycles, clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries observed on ultrasound. However, these criteria have limitations, and newer diagnostic strategies are being explored.
